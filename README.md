# Poolin
Basic simulation of a carpooling app
The program helps to simulate the working of a carpooling app. The user can choose to be the driver or a rider(passenger).
The passenger gives the starting address, the destination and the number of people accompanying them.
The driver provides the starting address, destination and the type of vehicle they drive;.
If the route of a driver coincides with the route chosen by the rider, the driver's information is shown to the rider. If their are many drivers, the rider can chose the driver based on cost, waiting time.
